#NotesApp (an repo by shivanshu tyagi)
head to https://pnotes.herokuapp.com to try the deployed verson of the app.

A Simple Notes app created using node-js, express-js, Mongo-db, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
it took me 5 days(nights XD) to make it, while learning (cz i didn't know how to make any such thing).

Frontend is developed by myself only with some help from google(some portions XD).
Backend is written completely written by me using the docs of the technologies used.

login authentication works by storing a cookie in your browser.

Middlewares used:
 1. bcryptjs : to hash password before storing them in db.
 2. body-parser :to parse the request sent by the browser to server.
 3. cookie-parser : to parse the cookies stored in browser.
 4. ejs : templating engine, used to create html webpages before sending them to the browser.
 5. express : Server Framework.
 6. mongodb : Database Provider.
 
feel free to fork in the project
